# Sportovní pes roku - Rails Application

Welcome to **Sportovní pes roku** - a Rails application designed for managing the annual competition of sport dogs within the **Club chovatelů kolií a šeltií** (KCHCS). This application allows club members to sign up their dogs for the competition, track their performance in various competitions throughout the year, and ultimately generate rankings based on specific rules.

## Functionality

- **Member Sign Up**: Only members of **Club chovatelů kolií a šeltií** (KCHCS) are allowed to sign up for the competition. They need to provide their first and last names to verify their membership status and gain access to the application's functionality.

- **Dog Registration**: Once signed up, members can register their dogs within the competition.

- **Competition Tracking**: Members can add details of each competition their dogs participate in, including the type of competition, points earned, and placement.

- **Point Calculation**: The application calculates points earned by each dog based on predefined rules. Points are awarded for completing tests and competitions, both domestically and internationally. 

- **Ranking**: The application provides real-time ranking updates for each dog. Rankings are continuously updated as new entries and competition results are added.
